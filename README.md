## Configuration

### Protection Settings

#### Enable .htaccess Protection
- **Default:** Enabled
- **Description:** Master switch for all protection features
- When enabled, the plugin will lock your .htaccess file and monitor for changes

- **Default:** Enabled
- **Description:** Automatically reset file permissions when unauthorized changes are detected
- Recommended to keep enabled for maximum security

#### Restore from Backup on Changes
- **Default:** Disabled  
- **Description:** Automatically restore original .htaccess content from backup when changes are detected

### File Status & Monitoring

The admin interface provides comprehensive information about:

- **File Information:** Path, permissions, last modified date, protection status
- **Monitoring Status:** Active monitoring, next/last check times, change statistics
- **Backup Information:** Backup availability, creation date, restoration history
- **Hash Verification:** Current vs stored file hash comparison

### Manual Actions

- **Check File Now:** Perform immediate file change detection
- **Lock File Now:** Manually apply read-only permissions to .htaccess file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå Plugin won't activate**
- Verify PHP version meets requirements (7.4+)
- Check file permissions on plugin directory
- Ensure .htaccess file exists and is readable
- Review WordPress error logs for specific errors

**‚ùå Monitoring not working**  
- Verify WP-Cron is functioning on your server
- Check that protection is enabled in plugin settings
- Look for blocked cron jobs in server configuration

**‚ùå Backup creation fails**
- Verify write permissions on plugin directory (`wp-content/plugins/htaccess-lockdown/backups/`)
- Check available disk space
- Review WordPress debug logs for filesystem errors

**‚ùå File locking fails**
- Verify server supports file permission changes
- Check if .htaccess file is owned by the web server user
- Some shared hosting providers may restrict permission changes

### Debug Mode

Enable WordPress debug logging to see detailed plugin activity:

```php
// Add to wp-config.php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
```

Check `/wp-content/debug.log` for HTAccess Lockdown messages.
