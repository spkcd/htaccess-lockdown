* Restore from Backup: Disabled

= Recommended Configuration =
For maximum security, we recommend:
* Keep "Enable .htaccess Protection" checked
* Keep "Auto Re-lock on Changes" checked
* Consider enabling "Restore from Backup" only if you don't frequently modify .htaccess

== DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS ==

The plugin requires specific permissions to function properly:

= Required Permissions =
* Plugin directory: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
* Backup directory: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
* .htaccess file: 644 initially (will be changed to 444 when locked)

1. Connect via FTP to your site
2. Navigate to /wp-content/plugins/htaccess-lockdown/
3. Set folder permissions to 755
4. Set backup folder permissions to 755
5. Ensure .htaccess file is writable initially (644)

define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);

Then check /wp-content/debug.log for HTAccess Lockdown messages.
